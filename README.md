# Introduction
This document defines the standards and best practices for writing, maintaining, and deploying infrastructure using Terraform at our organization. Following these guidelines will ensure consistency, maintainability, and scalability of our infrastructure code.

## Folder Structure
Organize Terraform configurations in a consistent folder structure to make it easier to navigate and manage.

```
├── modules
│ ├── network
│ ├── network
└── dev
├── stg
├── prd
```

## Modules
Utilize modules to encapsulate and reuse code. Follow these best practices when creating and using modules:

- Place modules in the modules/ directory.
- Use input variables for configuration.
- Use output variables to expose module results.
- Document module usage and parameters.

## Naming Conventions
Adhere to consistent naming conventions for resources, variables, and files.

- Use snake_case for resource names: `my_resource_name`.
- Use snake_case for variable names: `my_variable_name`.
- Prefix resource names with the environment: `dev-my-resource`.

## Code Style
Follow these code style guidelines to ensure readability and maintainability.

- Indent with 2 spaces.
- Use descriptive names for resources and variables.
- Group related resources together.
- Use comments to explain complex logic.

### Example
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type

  tags = {
    Name = "my_app_instance"
  }
}
```

## Version Control
Store Terraform configurations in a version control system (e.g., Git) using a trunk-based development approach.

- Use the main branch for production-ready code.
- Use short-lived feature branches for development.
- Protect the main branch with pull request reviews and approvals.
- Commit small, atomic changes with descriptive commit messages.

## State Management
Manage Terraform state effectively to ensure consistency and collaboration.

- Use remote state storage (e.g., S3) with state locking (e.g., DynamoDB) for shared environments.
- Configure state backend in backend.tf.
- Enable state versioning and encryption.

## Testing
Ensure the reliability of your Terraform configurations through testing.

- Use `terraform validate`` to check syntax and validity.
- Use `terraform plan`` to review changes before applying.
- Implement automated tests using tools like Terratest.

## CI/CD Pipeline
Integrate Terraform with your CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.

- Use GitLab CI to automate `terraform init`, `plan`, and `apply`.
- Include steps to validate and lint Terraform code.
- Implement approval gates for production deployments.

By adhering to these standards, we can ensure that our Terraform code is consistent, secure, and maintainable. This will help us manage our infrastructure more effectively and efficiently.
